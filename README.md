Diabetes diagnosis with a FCF neural network

This personal proyect consists in creating and training a simple fully conected forward neural network using Pytorch capable of diagnosing Diabetes given certain information about the patient: blood preasure, insulin level and age, among others.

The final accuracy reached by the network is 87% which for this case is acceptable, 37% higher than guessing (50%), but could be enhanced by using a larger dataset and changing the architecture or fine tuning the hyperparameters of the newral network.
