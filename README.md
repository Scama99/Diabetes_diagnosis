Diabetes diagnosis with a FCF neural network

This personal project consists in creating and training a simple fully connected forward neural network, using Pytorch, capable of diagnosing Diabetes given certain information about the patient: blood pressure, insulin level and age, among other data.

The final accuracy reached by the network is 87% which for this case is acceptable, 37% higher than guessing (50%), but could be enhanced by using a larger dataset, changing the architecture of the network or fine tuning the hyperparameters of the neural network.
